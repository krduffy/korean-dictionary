    Every state of the panel can be defined by a view and a value.
    Possible views are "homepage", "search_korean", "search_hanja", "detail_korean",
    "detail_hanja"
    These views are also stored in the history of the panel (see below).

    If the user searches "것" in the Korean dictionary, currentView will be set to
      {

      view          | value interpretation
      ==============|======================== 
      homepage      | (none)
      search_korean | search term (example: 줄, 바르락, 卽時)
      search_hanja  | search term (example: 時공간, 성, 畫龍點睛)
      detail_korean | target code [pk into database] (example: 98118, 24576)
      detail_hanja  | character [pk into database] (example: 畫, 龍, 點, 睛)

    Additionally, if view is set to "detail_korean", a third field "detail_korean_word"
    is present in the view; this is used only to put into the search text box if the
    detail_korean view is ever restored from history (to avoid api call on restore).

  /* Callbacks
    All of these use effects trigger in a chain to enforce synchronicity
    setCurrentView can be called by the following child components:
    1. fixed_header/SearchBar
    2. paginated_results/PaginatedResults (-> KoreanResult and HanjaResult)

    setPointer is only called in this Panel component and in fixed_header/ViewHistoryNavigator

    *There is a difference between changing these two things that correspond to two
    entrypoints into the useEffects!*

    Changing currentView is a certain change in view called when the user searches anything,
    clicks on anything that directs them to a page, etc. It is only after currentView has changed
    that it is checked whether there is an actual change in the history. If there is, the 
    callbacks start.

    Changing pointer is an uncertain change in view and is a "shortcut" to the end of the
    callbacks. Because it is only called by ViewHistoryNavigator and ViewHistoryNavigator
    cannot change history, there is no need to check and update it. However,  
    
    The reason for this callback hell implementation of a history feature
    is that the panels need separate histories that are stored separately and can be
    navigated without any effect on each other.
