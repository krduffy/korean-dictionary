~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
==================================
1. add form to create new user
2. add form to update user (change pw)
3. reinstate database after changing it to match new requirements
   add base user of "우리말샘" so that most of the base words will have 출처 우리말샘 and then otherwise it will just say 출처 키런 or whatever

change the display of the results to have buttons for add to list
and also make it so there are forms in the acutal dictionary to use the add views [ done for adding word ]

[ next refactoring of database ]
<sub> tags exist.
potentially move history to end of sense list (same for all senses?) => moved, but still in wrong(?) folder
