=================
finish results for korean word ( add other result things and make dropdown potentially0)
remove bugginess in back and forward (breaks if you go back and forth a few times; probably saving the wrong state or not overwriting when necessary)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
==================================
change the display of the results to have buttons for add to list
and also make it so there are forms in the acutal dictionary to use the add views [ done for adding word ]

<sub> tags exist.
potentially move history to end of sense list (same for all senses?) => moved, but still in wrong(?) folder
